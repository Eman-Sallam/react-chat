# React Js Chat App

**live demo: [https://eman-sallam.github.io/react-chat/](https://eman-sallam.github.io/react-chat/)**

## Project Description

A web-based chat interface that demonstrates capabilities in handling and displaying chat history, and simulates chat interactions by echoing user input. 
Develop capabilities to store chat sessions locally. This will allow the chat interface to save and display previous conversations when the user revisits the page.
Provide a feature to view and clear the chat history, demonstrating control over stored data.
It was mainly focused on React JS front-end development. I used CSS and Sass for styling. Also, this application used React Context API for state management.
